      <p>A favicon is an icon that can be seen on the top left of your webpage's tab and is used to represent the webpage or website. I made my favicon on Google Spreadsheets by changing colors of the boxes until I created something I liked. I chose to create the Batman logo because growing up Batman has been my favorite superhero and he believes in justice and is a hero which I admire.</p>
